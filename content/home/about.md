# Biography

Welcome to my homepage. I received my B.E. and Ph.D. degrees from the [Electronic Engineering Department](www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn) at Tsinghua University, China in 2010 and 2015, respectively. My advisor was Professor [Zhisheng Niu](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/ee/4157/2010/20101217200902455328237/20101217200902455328237_.html) from [Niulab](http://network.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/niulab). I visited the [WiDeS](http://wides.usc.edu/welcome/) group at University of Southern California, USA from 2013 to 2014, advised by Professor [Andreas F. Molisch](https://wides.usc.edu/founder.html). I then worked as an experienced researcher at [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/) from 2015 to 2016. I visited [ARNG](https://anrg.usc.edu/www/) at University of Southern California, USA, working with Professor [Bhaskar Krishnamachari](http://ceng.usc.edu/~bkrishna/) from 2017 to 2018. I worked as a wireless signal processing scientist at [Intel Labs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html), Hillsboro, USA during 2018. I'm now working as Professor of the School of Communications and Information Engineering ([SCIE](http://scie.shu.edu.cn/)) at Shanghai University, China. I also serve as an associate editor for IEEE [JCN](http://jcn.or.kr/html/).

We search for solutions that can address real-world problems and make theoretical sense.
