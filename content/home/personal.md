I played for the THU team from 2010 to 2015. We won the champion of Beijing College in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017, and the China College Baseball champion in 2009 (shared) at Guilin, 2013 at Tianjin, 2014 at Wuxi and 2015 at Dalian (shared).

I'm a fan of fantasy baseball and MLB. My favorate MLB team is [Boston Redsox](https://www.mlb.com/redsox/).
